# The Step Keyboard Layout




# Introduction
The QWERTY keyboard placed the most commonly used keys far away from each other to prevent typewriter jams.  The Step Keyboard Layout is designed with less typing
effort in mind, designed for a comfortable typing experience in English and Chinese Pinyin.

# Finger travel and the usage of the two middle columns
Typing some of the basic words on QWERTY requires a lot of movement, including lateral and diagonal movement. On Dvorak and Colemak, it's way more comfortable and 
achieves significantly less finger travel, but still requires a bit of lateral and diagonal movement. The Step keyboard layout is designed to reduce finger travel 
while also reduces lateral and diagonal movement. 

Step is also designed with less keystrokes on the middle columns as possible in mind. QWERTY has heavy reliance on the middle two columns with the T, H, Y and N, 
which are pretty frequent keys. Dvorak has I, D, F, Y on the middle two columns and Colemak has D, H on the middle columns. The heavy reliance on the middle 
columns means that you need to twist your wrists often which can be bad for your arms and wrists. Step only has K and punctuation on the middle columns so it requires less lateral 
movement from your arms and wrists, which ultimately reduces the risk of resulting in some repetitive motion injuries.

# Reduced load on the weaker fingers
Utilizing the weaker fingers often will make typists tired quickly. Step reduces the load on the weaker fingers and prioritizes stronger  fingers for most
of the typing.
